Patchwork Dir
=============

This directory contains files that would have been used to create a patched version of the timelinejs library that drew from local resources rather than fetching remote resources.

This effort was discontinued when a method to mitigate encountering CSP errors was discovered.

The npm package "diff" would have been used for the implementation.
